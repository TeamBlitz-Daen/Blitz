Problem statement :

Pregnancy is a complex and dynamic process that involves a variety of physiological changes and health risks. Preterm labor, gestational diabetes, and preeclampsia are all substantial dangers to mother and fetal health and are a major source of concern for healthcare providers.To assess the likelihood of difficulties during pregnancy, prenatal care has traditionally relied on demographic and medical history information. This strategy, however, has limitations in correctly forecasting and managing the risk of negative effects. Medical history data, for example, may not accurately reflect the current state of maternal health or the risk of complications, and demographic data, such as age and race, may not effectively reflect the underlying biological and environmental factors that contribute to the risk of complications.

List of pregnancy complications and their major contributing factors:

1.Gestational Diabetes : Having had gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy, Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS), Having pre-diabetes / Family History of Type 2 diabetes
                                                
2.Pre-Eclampsia:  Having had pre-eclampsia in a previous pregnancy, Multiple pregnancy (twins or more), Being pregnant for the first time
      
                                    
3.Pre-term labor: Other complications in the pregnancy (GD or pre-eclampsia), Tobacco and alcohol use / Substance abuse,prior preterm birth

                                    
4.Unnecessary C-Section: High blood pressure, Presence of pregnancy complications, Previous C-section

5.High/ low weight gain in the baby: Mother’s medical conditions, Mother’s diet during the pregnancy, Gestational age of the baby
